### Intro
This project is for European Innovation Academy, a 30-days entrepreneur program. Customers could order the homemade food by chatting with our humanized character: Fred!

### My works
1. Articulated problems and solutions to project managers and designers to finish the minimum value product in one week
2. Allowed users to find the nearest cooks by leveraging GeoFire library to generate location-based query
3. Generated natural language processing chatbot by leveraging Facebook messenger api, API.AI, and Node.js
