### Intro
For all current online services for cryptocurrency transactions, they lack some useful data for users to predict and understand the true mechanism behind the cryptocurrency. Therefore, we added and analyzed three crucial statistics in our services. One is recent activities on GitHub for that cryptocurrency. One is the community's discussion, such as comments or posts on Reddit, and the other is recent news related to that cryptocurrency. And we use those data to train the model to generate a future prediction for the price using Azure services and CNN by Keras library.
