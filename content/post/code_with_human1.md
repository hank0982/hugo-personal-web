As a programmer, I often write my code in PROGRAMMER's mind and review it again with my HUMAN's mind.

A well-trained programmer should know several basic concepts like data structure, algorithm, and programming language before writing the code. We are required to think about difficult issues like time complexity, security, or operating systems simultaneously. In other words, we write our code in an intelligent way and ignore the fact that other programmers might read your code in the future.

But you are not always that smart and memorize all the issues.  Especially when you look back to your previous code and try to understand it, you will find your code so hard to read. Sounds familiar? 

Here is my advice. Always review your code with HUMAN's mind. And when you check your code, throw away your programmer's mind and modify it so that every single person in the world can understand it.

Below are some excellent examples I find online.


```javascript
  if (sad() === true) {
    sad().stop();
    beAwesome();
  }
```

```python
  if coding:
    headphones = True
    focus = 100
    conversation = None
```

```javascript
  if (!tired()) {
    keepCoding();
  } else {
    drinkCoffee();
  }
```

You can quickly understand their intentions because they are closely aligned with natural language. Even if you are not a programmer, you can still guess their meaning correctly. Believe it or not. These code snippets are the end goal for your code. Every single person should be able to understand your code effortlessly.

So who wrote these codes? The answer is T-Shirt manufacturers (They write better code than me). If you write the code like this, whenever there is a modification or bug that needs to be revised, every programmer in your team can quickly identify the problem and fix it right away.

>Code is written to be read by humans, not computers

In the following series, I will examine different coding practices and review them from a human perspective.
